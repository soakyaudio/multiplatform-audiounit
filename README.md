# [AUv3 & SwiftUI: Embed Audio Unit Extensions in a Multiplatform App](https://soakyaudio.com/blog/multiplatform-audiounit)

This Xcode project serves as a reference for setting up a multiplatform (macOS & iOS) SwiftUI app with a bundled audio unit extension. A step-by-step guide can be found in the accompanying [blog post](https://soakyaudio.com/blog/multiplatform-audiounit).

The project was created using Xcode 14.2. If you wish to deploy it on iOS, you will need to specify a development team in the signing settings for both the main app and the extension target.
